# CodeAlpha_Credit_Scoring_Model
This project involves building a credit scoring model using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to predict an individual's creditworthiness based on financial data and payment history. The key components of the project are as follows:

Data Preprocessing: The dataset is loaded, cleaned, and preprocessed. Missing values are handled, and features are transformed as necessary to prepare them for modeling.

Feature Engineering: Relevant features such as income, loan amount, and payment history are selected. Data transformation techniques like normalization or scaling might be applied.

Modeling: Various machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Support Vector Machines (SVM), are trained on the dataset to classify creditworthiness.

Evaluation: Models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the ROC curve. Cross-validation ensures the robustness of the model.

Deployment: A final model can be deployed for real-time credit scoring or further analysis.
